                  q: "What credentials do modern employers actually look for?",
                  a: "Employers look for four things.\n\n1. Formal Education\n\nA degree or diploma still opens doors but it rarely closes the deal on its own. It tells an employer you can learn. It does not always tell them you can perform.\n\n2. Professional Training & Industry-Backed Certification\n\nIncreasingly, employers value proof that you have trained in the real world. Industry-recognized certifications and non-traditional training programs carry serious weight precisely because they are grounded in what the workplace actually demands. This is where Epocha comes in.\n\n3. Micro-Credentials\n\nShorter, sharper, and highly specific micro-credentials prove competence in a particular skill or area without requiring years of study. They are stackable, portable, and increasingly recognized by employers who want to know exactly what you can do. This is where Epocha comes in.\n\n4. Core Skills & Competencies\n\nCall them soft skills, interpersonal skills, human skills, or EPOCH competencies — these are the capabilities that determine how someone actually performs in a team, under pressure, and in the face of the unexpected. Communication, critical thinking, emotional intelligence, adaptability, leadership. No degree automatically builds them. This is where Epocha comes in.\n\nRemember, a degree tells employers you can learn. The rest show them you are ready.",

                  a: "No. It was never designed to. A degree gives you the theory. Our practicums give you the practical application, micro-credentials, and human skills that make that theory useful in the real world. Think of it as the layer that enhances your education; the part that turns a graduate into someone employers want to hire.",
